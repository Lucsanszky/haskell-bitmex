# haskell-bitmex

An unofficial Haskell API for the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange.
Contributions are more than welcome!

## Building
Just run `cabal new-build all` from the project root. 
This will build the auto-generated REST API and the client which contains some convenience functions
and the WebSocket API.
